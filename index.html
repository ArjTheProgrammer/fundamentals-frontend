            As someone who supports JB at every game, I've witnessed firsthand
            how Fundamentals has transformed his performance on the court. The
            app has helped me understand basketball metrics better, making our
            post-game discussions more insightful. It's not just for players -
            it's for anyone who loves the game!

            Being part of the CCIT basketball team means I need to constantly
            elevate my game. Fundamentals gives me the structure and
            accountability I was missing. I can track my progress, set realistic
            goals, and see tangible improvements. My coach has noticed the
            difference in my consistency and basketball IQ since I started using
            the app.

            As someone who competes in various open leagues, I needed a way to
            stay consistent between games and tournaments. Fundamentals has
            become my training companion, helping me identify patterns in my
            performance and areas to improve. 2Now I feel more prepared and
            confident whenever I step on the court.

            Fundamentals has been a game-changer for my basketball journey. The
            skill tracking helps me identify my weaknesses and consistently work
            on them. After three months of using this app, my shooting
            percentage improved. The drill suggestions are perfect for focused
            practice.

          We’re a group of four students who combined our passion for basketball
          and technology to create Fundamentals—a skills tracker made for
          players who want to improve every day. <br /><br />
          Three of us are student-athletes who know what it takes to build up
          your game from the ground up. We’ve spent hours practicing, looking
          for drills, and trying to stay consistent. We wanted a better way to
          stay on track—and that’s how Fundamentals was born. <br />
          <br />
          With our combined experience in sports and web development, we created
          a tool that’s simple, practical, and built to support every player’s
          growth—whether you're just starting out or training daily.
